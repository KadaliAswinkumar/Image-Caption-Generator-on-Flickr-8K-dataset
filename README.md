# Image-Caption-Generator-on-Flickr-8K-dataset

Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision. It includes the labeling of an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. Imagenet dataset is used to train the CNN model called Xception. Xception is responsible for image feature extraction. These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model which in turn generates the image caption.

Image-caption generator on Flickr-8K dataset using LSTM and CNN is a natural language processing project that generates textual descriptions for images in the Flickr-8K dataset. The project combines two powerful deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), to learn the correlation between visual features of an image and textual descriptions.

The Flickr-8K dataset contains 8,000 images, each with five textual descriptions, making a total of 40,000 descriptions. The first step in the project is to preprocess the data, including resizing the images, extracting features using a pre-trained CNN, and encoding the textual descriptions into a numerical format.

The CNN is responsible for extracting the visual features of the images, while the LSTM is responsible for generating the textual descriptions based on the visual features. The CNN extracts the features of the images, which are then fed into the LSTM as input. The LSTM processes the input features sequentially, generating words one by one, until it generates a complete sentence.

The LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed data using a loss function such as cross-entropy, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual captions. The model is trained iteratively until the loss function is minimized.

Once the model is trained, it can generate captions for new images by feeding the image features into the LSTM model. The LSTM generates a sequence of words that form a descriptive sentence for the image.

The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. These metrics evaluate the similarity between the generated captions and the actual captions in the dataset.

Overall, the image-caption generator on Flickr-8K dataset using LSTM and CNN is a powerful tool for generating textual descriptions for images. It can be used in various applications, including image search engines, automatic image captioning for visually impaired individuals, and social media platforms.
